  <h1>Minevolution History</h1>
  <h2>TheVoid's Idea</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER: I AM GOING OFF OF PUBLIC DATA FOR THIS SECTION. THIS IS BECAUSE THEVOID HAS
      BEEN OFFLINE FOR 6 YEARS AND IS NOT ABLE TO FILL IN!</span><br>
    Back sometime in 2014 a <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/">Curseforge</a> user named TheVoid
    wanted to test the limits of the efficiency enchantment. Out of this came a minigame idea. I assume that
    out of this the idea evolved as the map was built. Logdtzip a big Minecraft Youtuber played the map and blew
    it up. LogDotZip got a version of the map that was never released, a completely revamped beta was released,
    and most people didn't like it. At this point TheVoid drops off the face of the Earth.
  </p>
  <h2>A Late Intrest</h2>
  <p>
    Enter me. In 2018 youtube reccomends me a video by LogdotZip from 4 you years previous.
    Of course I check out the map. As I have a coding passion, I tried to fix the bugs.
    I realized that the issues were in the Minecraft version itself. As the VERY next version was
    command block update, I had to completely re-do the entire thing. This is where I picked up. From scratch.
  </p>
  <h2>A Slow Trek</h2>
  <p>
    Two years. It took two years to finally figure out how to treat the now smart villagers.
    I still havent created a working version of the map as of 2/15/2021. These two years I
    have learned a lot about commands and datapacks. I first created an infinite storage room that
    was very laggy. I released a half built re-design to version 1.12.2 vowing never to update past
    1.13 as all the commands had changed, also removing one of the commands that was essential to
    the map functioning. At this time I did not realize that this command had just been merged with
    another one and when I attempted to update to 1.14 with the release of a command essential in
    future planned updates, I had to find out how to use it. Then of course villagers sucked.
    They got smart. This is why I still havent made a new update that works.
  </p>
  <h2>The Future</h2>
  <p>
    As of 2/15/2021 the future contains a lot.<br>
    I plan on completing beta number 3 for the version 3.0.0.0.0 and providing hotfixes after that.
    These hotfixes will attempt to add any features I missed(I have been very unorganized), squash bugs,
    and add the new tiers I want to add before I update to caves and cliffs(1.17).
    After all this I might as well make the update, adding to the world some of the builds I have wanted to add,
    working on the banks update, and making sure everything works smoothly. I also plan to add a new custom
    shops system. This should erase the issue with villagers discounting my prices. After this will come
    either the Tier Expansion or the Exploration update. This is due to the fact that if I don't
    have dungeons ready to import into the Minevolution world then I need to have another update available.
    As 1.17 will be out at this point this update sounds ideal. Even though it would take longer to get
    Dungeons in as I would have to add the update to more tiers(as per current plans), it would be content
    Both updates WILL be coming, it is just the order that I don't have down.
