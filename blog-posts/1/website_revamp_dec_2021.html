      Hello There! This is the first post on the manual blog!<br>
      In this post I will be listing off the main changes in this revamp!<br><br>
      Starting with the most obvious, I am releasing the manual version of the blog.
      This will be used to create and test all of the blog features that I will need to make.<br><br>
      Now for the homepage!<br>
      The homepage has gotten a new look! It is not yet finalized, but it is really close to final style.<br><br>
      There are a couple of global changes on the website!<br>
      First off, the footer on all pages has been updated. The images have been reduced to 64x64, and
      when you hover over the discord icon, it will now get a ping.<br>
      Next is the font. The font has been updated to be the same, but a more readable version.<br><br>
      Apps and Games are splitting!<br>
      The Games that I have created are being split off into their own page. Only a couple changes have
      been released presently, but a majority of the update is still coming!<br><br>
      That is all for now! Updates will be posted as edits!<br>
    </p>
