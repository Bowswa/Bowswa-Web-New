            Back sometime in 2014 a <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/">Curseforge</a> user named TheVoid<br>
            wanted to test the limits of the efficiency enchantment. Out of this came a minigame idea. I assume that<br>
            out of this the idea evolved as the map was built. Logdtzip a big Minecraft Youtuber played the map and blew<br>
            it up. LogDotZip got a version of the map that was never released, a completely revamped beta was released,<br>
            and most people didn't like it. At this point TheVoid drops off the face of the Earth.

            Enter me. In 2018 youtube reccomends me a video by LogdotZip from 4 you years previous.<br>
            Of course I check out the map. As I have a coding passion, I tried to fix the bugs.<br>
            I realized that the issues were in the Minecraft version itself. As the VERY next version was<br>
            command block update, I had to completely re-do the entire thing. This is where I picked up. From scratch.<br>

            <dd>This MineCraft map started out as a fun test of how powerful efficiency could get with TheVoid.
                Then he had the idea to make a minigame out of it. A major Youtuber named LogDotZip came and
                played the map for a while. When he stoped playing because of how buggy the map was, Thevoid
                completly remade the map. It was horrible, and recieved a lot of negative feedback. He then
                quit. I took the map and started to remake it. First i started work on upgrading the map to
                later updates to make sure that it was not as buggy, as a lot of the bugs were in MineCraft
                itself. I updated to 1.9 updates and realised that these updates were the commmand block
                updates. So i started to remake all the command blocks. I then updated to 1.12.2 as this
                update was way more stable. I released the first version by me in this version. I vowed to
                never update past 1.12 because of 1.13 command updates. Then 1.14 came out. I could not get
                the villager shops to work until 1.15, but there were importiant features. I had made a
                level up system for the stone to help advance the map. It also opened a lot more opportnities.
                This is the MINEVOLUTION!!!</dd>
