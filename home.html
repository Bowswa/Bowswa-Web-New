    <p>I still have a lot to learn about JavaScript, but HTML and CSS i have mastered.</p>
    <p>
      I love making games. I have some datapacks that are meant to re-vamp the game.<br>
      I also play a lot of games. One of them is Hypixel Skyblock.<br>
      I low key am kind of addicted to it as well.<br>
      I also spend a lot of time with friends and family when I can.<br>
      I also like to stream on my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bowswa">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyHS9aOtHuGgBJtHmszyeBg">Youtube</a> when I can.<br>
      The last thing I do is sleep. Believe me or not sleeping can bereally fun. I personally use lucid dreaming 
      to get the most out of sleep.<br>
